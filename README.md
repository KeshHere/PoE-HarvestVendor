## FAQ
**Q. Why does it show lv00?**  
A. If its unable to read the level it says lv00. You can try delete the craft and rescan it. Or fix the level manualy.

**Q. I'm getting error about "WinInet-something"**  
A. This one?  
![](examples/https-error.png)  
Get curl binary from [here](https://curl.se/windows/), extract curl.exe from archive and put in into directory with ahk script. Script now will use this tool for version checking.

**Q. A craft i have in horticrafting station is not showing up in the result**  
A. There are 2 possible reasons:
  1. text recognition was too messed up and i couldn't recognize the craft  
    - Solution: Run the scan again and select only that one craft
  2. I arbitrarily decided its not worth to list that one, if you want it listed, contact me or open an issue. [List of ignored crafts](https://github.com/esge/PoE-HarvestVendor/wiki/Crafts-that-are-being-ignored)

**Q. Help! When I try and take a screenshot, I get the following error about finding a file:**
![](examples/cantReadFile.png)  

A. The most likely cause for this is that your folder structure containing Capture2Text is incorrect, and you may have an additional folder. Please ensure that your folder structure looks like:

```
|--> Poe-HarvestVendor
|----> Capture2Text
|-------->  *files for the software, NOT another folder*
|----> PoeHarvestVendor.exe
```

and does NOT look like:

```
|--> Poe-HarvestVendor
|----> Capture2Text
|--------> Capture2Text
|--------> *files for the software, NOT another folder*
|----> PoeHarvestVendor.exe
```

Once you've sorted out the folder structure, try restarting the application to see if it now works.

## Used libraries
- http://capture2text.sourceforge.net/ for OCR
- https://github.com/cocobelgica/AutoHotkey-JSON jxon function embeded in the main file
